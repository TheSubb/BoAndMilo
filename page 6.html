  <p>&ldquo;Bo.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Leo.&rdquo;<br>
The two faced off, relaxed, waiting for their cue.<br>
&ldquo;Drummed up quite the noise, I see.&rdquo; Leo gestured  toward the crowd, responding in cheers.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m figuring it out as I go, I guess.&rdquo; Bo admitted.<br>
&ldquo;More like copying my style.&rdquo; Leo accused.<br>
&ldquo;What? I mean, I-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Save it. You&rsquo;re up against <em>me</em> now. And nobody fights as good as me.&rdquo; he bragged.<br>
&ldquo;Arrhhh..&rdquo; He let out in annoyance. <br>
Bo studied Leo, remembering an earlier realization.<br>
&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t you realize we&rsquo;re the same?&rdquo; he genuinely  asked.<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Leo narrowed his eyes on  him.<br>
&ldquo;Like, we&rsquo;re both human. I haven&rsquo;t been around much,  but nobody is like us. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed?&rdquo; Bo thought to Leo.<br>
&ldquo;Hmph. Don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t care. These are my people.  Not you.&rdquo; Leo bluntly laid on Bo.<br>
&ldquo;Bu-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, WIZARDS AND  SPIRITS, THIEVES AND CREATURES, MAY I PRESENT TO YOU THE FINAL CHALLENGE, THE  END ALL BE ALL, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH, THE DUEL OF THE MILLENIA, BECAUSE LET&rsquo;S BE HONEST IT&rsquo;S BEEN A PRETTY BORING ONE, I GIVE YOU, BO VS LEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&rdquo; the crowd erupted, piercing the opening dome&rsquo;s  sky, revealing the natural afternoon light once again.<br>
&ldquo;HANDS, PLEASE TAKE TWENTY PACES BACK AND WAIT FOR THE  KING&rsquo;S HORN!!!!&rdquo;<br>
Leo gave one last eyeing glimpse before turning his  back to Bo and counting his paces back. With his mind made up, Bo turned and  counted.<br>
One, two, three, he felt the rush, four, five, six, he  felt the butterflies, seven, eight, nine, he felt the eyes, ten, eleven,  twelve, he felt the adrenaline, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, he felt the blood,  sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, he felt everything, nineteen, twenty. Turn.<br>
He locked Leo&rsquo;s fiery gaze. Taking one last deep breath, he reached for the  hilt of his sword on his back and the other on Dio.<br>
<em>WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWMPH, </em>The horn blared. <br>
The two started slowly walking towards each other,  drawing their weapons. Leo took a defensive stance, circling Bo, hand on hilt,  ready. Bo still didn&rsquo;t know exactly how to fight. Just what he thought and felt  was right. And right now, he felt this wouldn&rsquo;t be won with a sword.<br>
The two circled each other, waiting for the other to  make the first move. Both patient. But not that patient. <br>
Bo drew Dio in an attempt to disarm Leo like he did  Lacy. But Leo was quicker. He swept his sword behind him to his off-hand, as  Dio instead caught Leo&rsquo;s empty hand. Leo then swung down on Dio, causing him to  flinch back.<br>
Bo staggered backward at the force, and Leo followed  up with a flurry of strikes. Left, right, left, top. He had Bo on his heels as  he tried to keep his balance and body away from the blade.<br>
Leo continued his assault, applying more and more  pressure on Bo. The crowd let out a gasp. <br>
Not being able to keep up, Bo switched pace and  committed to falling backward, tucking and rolling, gaining distance from Leo. <br>
Leo halted his assault and resumed his defensive  stance, watching for Bo to make another mistake. But Bo had another idea. <br>
He drew his sword and threw his bag on the ground. The  two circled it until Bo kicked the bag up at Leo, forcing a strikeout of him in  which he countered with his own. <br>
Yet again, Leo was too quick. He was able to slice the  bag away and counter Bo&rsquo;s follow up attack. <br>
The two clashed and traded blows for several strikes,  Bo holding onto dear life. Leo had him on the ropes as he threw a low kick into  his combo, tripping Bo and swinging down on him. <br>
Managing to hold the clash, sword to throat, Bo used  all his strength to shove Leo&rsquo;s sword off of him. Suddenly, Dio started to glow  again, maneuvering through the clashing blades and socked Leo right in the  face, sending him flying and disarmed.<br>
The crowd cried in horror and surprise at Bo yet  again. <br>
Bo struggled to his feet, taking a moment to catch his  breath and rub his throat.<br>
&ldquo;I-I love you, Dio, y-you know that?&rdquo; Bo panted out.<br>
&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s finish this together.&rdquo; he nodded to  Dio, and what he could only imagine was a nod back.<br>
Bo looked over to Leo, rising to his feet.<br>
&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; Leo examined the blood he swiped across his  lip.<br>
&ldquo;Alright, then. Fine. You wanna fight that way. I&rsquo;ll  fight that way.&rdquo; He muttered under his breath.<br>
Leo took a deep breath and whistled, ringing  throughout the open colosseum and beyond.<br>
Bo slowly started approaching Leo again.<br>
&ldquo;You know what my Hand is, Bo?&rdquo; Leo smirked.<br>
&ldquo;Uh, your sword or armor? Right?&rdquo; Bo guessed. He  wasn&rsquo;t sure this whole time, but he had to have seen it at some point in the  contest, right?<br>
A distant roar echoed in the distance. One Bo couldn&rsquo;t  recognize through sound but could through feeling. And it made his stomach  drop.<br>
&ldquo;May I present to you my lifelong BEST friend and  Hand, Bolt.&rdquo; he gestured as a yellow dragon five times the size of Bo dropped  into the arena, curling around Leo. With its white mane flowing, dark yellow  horns, white curled eyes, and a mouth full of sparks.<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not&hellip; very&hellip; fair&hellip;&rdquo; Bo let out, taking in the  majestic beast.<br>
&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s not fair, Bo.&rdquo; Leo explained.<br>
&ldquo;Get used to it.&rdquo; he suggested as he patted Bolt,  letting out a jolt of lightning towards Bo. Bo moved, escaping the initial  blast zone but not the explosion that followed.<br>
<br>
Bo&rsquo;s ears rang, vision blurred, clothes charred, and  smoking. Everything hurt. He laid there, just breathing and staring at the  clear blue sky. <br>
He couldn&rsquo;t fight anymore. How could he? Leo was  obviously better than him in every way. He had armor, real training, a freaking  dragon for a Hand. It was over.<br>
&ldquo;Bo&hellip;&rdquo; the voice whispered again.<br>
&ldquo;H-uh. N-not, now.&rdquo; He gasped out in pain. Watching  the pink glow cover him.<br>
&ldquo;Pink.. glow?&rdquo; Bo realized. It was Dio. He was doing&hellip;  something.<br>
Leo and the crowd watched in awe at the magical  display. Leo being hesitant to let this go on but too intrigued to let go.<br>
The glow started to consume Bo. Mending his wounds,  his charred clothes, his fatigue, until he looked and felt brand new.<br>
&ldquo;Agh, AGGHHHHHHH!&rdquo; Bo gasped up and coughed smoke and  blood out. He studied his now healed body and clothes, feeling brand new. As energetic  and confident as ever.<br>
The crowd cheered in amazement, with the King, Custo,  the princess, and Milo on the edge of their seat. <br>
&ldquo;ARE YOU SEEING WHAT I&rsquo;M SEEING, FOLKS! BO JUST TOOK A  FULL LIGHTNING BOLT TO THE FACE AND IS WALKING IT OFF LIKE IT WAS NOTHING! WE  ALL HAD OUR DOUBTS, BUT THIS IS LUDICROUS! I&rsquo;M LITERALLY EATING MY MIC RIGHT  NOW!!!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Bo said, admiring the work on him.<br>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it right this time.&rdquo; he patted Dio as the  pillars started operating again.<br>
&ldquo;Pshh. Whatever. I let you do that anyway. Makes this  more&hellip; interesting.&rdquo; Leo played off.<br>
&ldquo;Plus, Bolt loves playing with his food.&rdquo; he smirked  as he patted Bolt again, sending another jolt at Bo. <br>
Except this time, he was ready. With Dio in hand, Bo  advanced towards the jolt, absorbing it with Dio and releasing it into the sky  with the crack of lightning filling the air.<br>
&ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo; Leo started to panic, patting Bolt to fire  more jolts at Bo.<br>
But it didn&rsquo;t matter as Bo absorbed each one,  releasing it in an instant to the sky, filling the static air. <br>
&ldquo;Grrrah! FINE! Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo; Leo composed himself  and hopped on Bolt, kicking up for liftoff.<br>
Leo and Bolt rose high up in the sky before nose-diving  down at high speed for Bo. But again, Bo was ready. He&rsquo;d done this already.  Just a bit bigger this time.<br>
As the dive came in, Bo dove to the ground as Bolt  skimmed him. As they made their pass, Bo latched onto Bolt with Dio.<br>
Gaining altitude, Bo held onto Dio for life, climbing  the beast.<br>
&ldquo;What the- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!&rdquo; Leo lashed out,  trying to kick Bo off of Bolt. <br>
But Bo didn&rsquo;t come this far to falter now. He ate the  kicks, continuing his climb.<br>
&ldquo;JUST..GIVE..UP!&rdquo; Leo screamed, trying to smash Bo&rsquo;s  face in more.<br>
&ldquo;Agh..errrrhhg...n-NEVER!&rdquo; Bo yelled out, advancing  further up the dragon.<br>
Bolt suddenly started another nosedive in hopes of  shaking Bo off.<br>
&ldquo;AHHHHHHHHHH!!!&rdquo;  Leo and Bo both let out in terror as Bolt was fed up with this.<br>
As they approached the ground, Bo latched onto Leo&rsquo;s  foot, with Dio tangled around Bolt&rsquo;s leg in his off-hand. <br>
&ldquo;LET GO OF ME YOU, YOU PILLOCK!&rdquo; Leo screeched.<br>
&ldquo;YOU&hellip; FIRST!&rdquo; Bo shouted, shoving Leo off balance by  dragging his leg off Bolt, sending him dragging across the ground. Coming loose  and wiping out across the floor.<br>
&ldquo;AAAAHAHAHAHA, WE DID IT, DIO!&rdquo; Bo celebrated while  still strapped to Bolt, gaining altitude again.<br>
&ldquo;Wait, oh, uh, go down.&rdquo; Bo asked, patting Bolt  politely.<br>
Bolt snarled and started taking evasive maneuvers.<br>
&ldquo;AAAAAAAHHHHH YOU'RE GONNA KILL US ALL!&rdquo; Bo screamed,  trying his best to mantle the dragon.<br>
But this only freaked Bolt out more, sending him into  a chaotic spiral, slamming into the rising and falling pillars, crumbling the  arena around them.<br>
&ldquo;NONONONO, YOU&rsquo;RE GONNA HURT PEOPLE&rdquo; Bo begged as Bolt  ran through the debris, wounding his wings.<br>
He wasted no time and abandoned the spiraling dragon, jumping to falling  debris, desperately trying to slow his fall.<br>
But it was too much. He got clipped and pelted from  broken pillar to broken pillar until he was finally crushed and crash-landed.<br>
<br>
As the debris cloud rose, Milo looked on in complete  focus.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit, that was closer than I thought it would  be, Milo.&rdquo; The armored figure rose.<br>
&ldquo;Sit down. It&rsquo;s not over.&rdquo; Milo told him, still  focused on the cloud.<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over Milo, I win. Again.&rdquo; The armored man  concluded and walked out.<br>
Milo stayed focused on the cloud of dust covering the  shattered arena. Those who didn&rsquo;t flee, breath held.<br>
As the dust settled, two faint figures came to shape.  One on top of the other. Sword to throat. <br>
We had a winner.<br>
The dust finally clearing as a badly wounded Leo stood  over an unconscious, broken Bo.<br>
The crowd erupted into a roar of chants and applause  one last time before rushing over to Leo, carrying him to the proud King, an  ecstatic Custo, and a disappointed princess.<br>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Milo breathed out in sadness.<br>
He reached into the void, appearing beside Bo, picking  him up carefully, and portaling them back home.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I knew this was a dumb idea, Fate.&rdquo; Death raged.<br>
&ldquo;Why do I always trust you?&rdquo; He ranted on.<br>
&ldquo;Because you know I&rsquo;m <em>eventually</em> right.&rdquo; Fate teased.<br>
&ldquo;Tsch.&rdquo; Death grunted.<br>
&ldquo;Not this time. He failed.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No. He didn&rsquo;t. This was supposed to happen. He&rsquo;s  going to be fine.&rdquo; Fate reassured.<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about?! I have him <em>right here</em>. He&rsquo;s mine. AGAIN.&rdquo; Death was  baffled, holding Bo&rsquo;s soul, juggling it back and forth.<br>
&ldquo;Just wait for it.&rdquo; Fate said, annoyed, paying close  attention to Bo&rsquo;s soul.<br>
&ldquo;Wait for <em>what</em> exactly?&rdquo; Death narrowed his vision, growing impatient.<br>
When all of a sudden, Bo&rsquo;s soul started to glow,  dispersing back into reality.<br>
&ldquo;What the?! Who has the power to do <em>that</em>?<br>
&ldquo;As I said, I&rsquo;m eventually right.&rdquo; Fate smirked at  Death.<br>
&ldquo;So what was the point of all that then?! Kid had to  die to learn a lesson?&rdquo; Death asked abruptly.<br>
Fate walked away, studying herself in the reflection  of the silver pool.<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And then it was black again. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;GAAAAAAAAHHHHH!&rdquo; Bo sprang up, panting.<br>
&ldquo;MILO, MILO, MI-lo?&rdquo; Bo stopped, catching Milo resting  in a nearby chair holding Mr. Cups.<br>
&ldquo;Oh, hey, buddy. You feeling alright?&rdquo; Milo asked.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah... I am now. That was crazy.&rdquo; Bo wandered off.<br>
&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t tell what was a dream and what wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; I  woke up on a shore, I met you, we fought this orange beast, I had my own  outfit, became a&hellip; a hand&hellip; and I fought in a coliseum with these crazy powerful  and magical people and&hellip; and I almost beat them all!.. until I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;. I was  crushed, and then it was just blank&hellip;. I heard some voices&hellip;. voices I feel like  I should recognize, but I&hellip;. I don't remember, and I can't make any sense of  it&hellip;&rdquo; Bo trailed off again.<br>
&ldquo;That was all real, Bo.&rdquo; Milo admitted, clenching his  drained crystal necklace in hand.<br>
&ldquo;And you <em>lived</em>.  That&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo; Petting Mr. Cups.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. No matter what  happens, the only thing that matters is coming home after a long day. And after  an adventure like that, I feel like, with enough practice, we can do anything  together.&rdquo; Bo wondered, laying in comfort.<br>
&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo; Milo softly asked in wonder.<br>
&ldquo;Anything&hellip;&rdquo; Bo dreamt.</p>

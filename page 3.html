  <p>&ldquo;<span style="font-weight: 400">I thin</span>k that went pretty well.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Eh, I bet you do.&rdquo; Milo rolled his eyes.<br>
The two started their stroll home when a flyer blew  into Bo&rsquo;s face. He read &ldquo;THE CONTEST OF HANDS!&rdquo; in big, bold letters.<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Contest Of Hands?&rdquo; Bo squinted at the  paper.<br>
&ldquo;Ha, already another one.&rdquo; Milo thought out loud.<br>
&ldquo;What do you mean.&rdquo; Bo tilted his head.<br>
&ldquo;Nothing, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;It says here win the tournament for an offer to be Kingdom Viridian&rsquo;s Hand.&rdquo;  Bo grew excited.<br>
&ldquo;Like I said, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; Milo said  bluntly.<br>
&ldquo;But I need work, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Bo pleaded.<br>
&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll get work in time. Once people start to know your name.&rdquo; he  explained.<br>
&ldquo;Well, what better way than for competing in a  tournament for a kingdom.&rdquo; he had Milo there, and he knew it.<br>
&ldquo;Nope. You&rsquo;re not ready. End of discussion.&rdquo; Milo concluded, pulling ahead of  Bo.<br>
Casually strolling ahead, a passing Driller, small  flying dark blue bugs that are all eyes and drill, attacked him.<br>
&ldquo;What the.&rdquo; he thought, swatting away the pest. <br>
It must&rsquo;ve been a coincidence. And when he thought  that, two more stung him.<br>
&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; he let out angrily, staring up at the sky as  he was stung once more.<br>
&ldquo;You know what, Bo, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Milo turned back,  shouting.<br>
&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; Bo squeezed the flyer tight.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, I mean, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen!&rdquo; he thought.<br>
&ldquo;Get your name tarnished, or break all your bones, or  die, or&hellip; well.&rdquo; Milo was sweating bullets.<br>
&ldquo;Milo?&rdquo; Bo poked him.<br>
&ldquo;EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. I&rsquo;M FINE. YOU&rsquo;RE FINE. WE&rsquo;RE GONNA BE FINE.&rdquo; he  freaked out, shaking Bo back.<br>
&ldquo;Maybe this isn&rsquo;t such a good idea then&hellip;&rdquo; Bo stood  awkwardly.<br>
&ldquo;NO. I mean, ahem, no. You&rsquo;ll do great.&rdquo; he reassured  Bo, patting him on the back with a pathetic smile.<br>
&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I know so.&rdquo; he struggled, keeping the grin together.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Milo? Wake up, Milo!&rdquo; Bo lightly shook Milo.<br>
&ldquo;Hmmf&hellip;? No, no, Mr. Cups. It&rsquo;s yours by right&hellip;&rdquo; Milo  drooled, turning over the couch.<br>
&ldquo;Uh, Milo?&rdquo; he flicked his head.<br>
&ldquo;Huh, what. I didn&rsquo;t take nothin.&rdquo; He defended, half  asleep.<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time!&rdquo; Bo shouted in his face.<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about? We still have&hellip;&rdquo; Milo  slapped his wrist, causing a star consolation to appear.<br>
&ldquo;5 hours.&rdquo; he slumped back to sleep.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, but&hellip; I&hellip; don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; Milo let out a sigh, eyes wide open now.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s the game plan.&rdquo; Milo slapped a portal  he conjured, drawing and writing in it.<br>
&ldquo;We're going to leave and head to Viridian Colosseum.  We are going to register you for the contest through a guy named Custo.&rdquo; Milo  stopped writing and glanced at Bo.<br>
&ldquo;Let me handle him. You just stand there, and uh&hellip;&rdquo;  Milo watched Bo listen intensely.<br>
&ldquo;Be you. Once entered, you will be separated from me  until the tournament is over. I will be in the stands, or more precisely two  hundred and seventy degrees West, row one, seat one, right next to the main  gate. You and Dio will then compete in a series of challenges that will test  each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. Try your best to impress the King, and  more importantly, the crowd.&rdquo; he outlined, slapping the crowd part, rippling  the portal.<br>
&ldquo;Now for the rules.&rdquo; Milo cleared his throat and wrote in big letters.<br>
&ldquo;Mind your manners, do not speak unless spoken to,  don&rsquo;t stick your neck out, and most importantly, don&rsquo;t make any friends.&rdquo;  Circling that last part.<br>
&ldquo;Why that last part?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around these parts awhile. Nobody in that kingdom is worth your time  if it isn&rsquo;t for some coin. Understood?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Great. Let&rsquo;s get going then.&rdquo; He said, clapping his  hands of blue dust.<br>
<br>
So the two set out on the green path to Viridian.  Following the sound of distant cheering and excitement. Running a bit behind  thanks to Milo&rsquo;s over-preparedness, they finally arrived at the coliseum gates  only to be greeted by a dense crowd.<br>
&ldquo;Hurry up, hurry up! Hands must be punctual!&rdquo; a rather  tall and slim olived colored man, flashing the fanciest drab of green and  yellow, shoving the crowd of Hands into an organized line.<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Custo, the King&rsquo;s left-hand man.&rdquo; Milo iced  out.<br>
&ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s the right?&rdquo; Bo asked curiously.<br>
&ldquo;His good Hand.&rdquo; Milo elbowed Bo.<br>
&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Bo let out a grin, catching on.<br>
&ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;re assigning groups. Better run up  there and get a spot in line. I&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo;<br>
So Bo took haste, leaping in line, catching the  careful eye of Custo.<br>
&ldquo;And you are..?&rdquo; Custo questioned as he studied the mysterious boy.<br>
&ldquo;Bo, sir.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Bo, what?&rdquo; Custo probed.<br>
&ldquo;Uh, just Bo, sir.&rdquo; Bo sweated off.<br>
&ldquo;Bo hmm.... Bo&hellip; Bo.. Bo. Not on the list.&rdquo; Custo  confirmed, tapping his fancy clipboard with his fancy pen.<br>
&ldquo;But..&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<em>But</em>, Bo, you&rsquo;re late. The King&rsquo;s  Hand can&rsquo;t be late now, can he?&rdquo; Custo snapped.<br>
Bo gazed down, his confidence fading.<br>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ah, there he is!&rdquo; Custo clapped in joy, shoving Bo  aside.<br>
&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t the Hand of the hour!&rdquo; he giddied as a golden boy in full  green and gold armor swept past the line accompanied by a similar but much older  figure. The two looked identical to Bo, wondering if he&rsquo;d finally find other  humans.<br>
&ldquo;Make yourself at home, General and sir Leo!&rdquo; Custo  gestured the two towards the colosseum as they brushed past him. Not offering  as much as an eye for anyone.<br>
&ldquo;Hey, what gives? He was later than me?!&rdquo; Bo  protested.<br>
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re the prodigy of the father of the royal  fist, then you&rsquo;ll know what <em>gives</em>.&rdquo;  Custo spat out to Bo, shoving him out of line again.<br>
The crowded line was growing more and more restless  with shouts of annoyance.<br>
&ldquo;Now, now, everyone! This will be your first test of  four!&rdquo; he announced, pacing back and forth, organizing a line together.<br>
&ldquo;The judgment test! It's quite simple. I will work my  way down the line, and you will present yourself and your Hand to me. Impress  me, and you may enter. Failure to do so, and you will be sent home.&rdquo; Custo  announced with a wicked smile. <br>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started, shall we!&rdquo;<br>
Without hesitance, Custo started outing the  contestants, quickly moving his way up the line. Bo looked around hopelessly  for Milo. He would have to take matters into his own hands and snuck back into  line in hopes of getting one more shot with Custo, as much as it pained him.<br>
&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; Custo questioned Bo.<br>
&ldquo;Uhh, I&rsquo;m Bo? We just went over this.&rdquo; his eye twitched.<br>
&ldquo;Ah yes, the show up.&rdquo; Custo judged.<br>
&ldquo;And where might your hand be?&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s right here. This is Dio.&rdquo; Bo presented as  Dio waved, nested around his neck.<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; a scarf. A magical scarf.&rdquo; Custo snorted.<br>
&ldquo;Well&hellip; yeah?&rdquo;<br>
Custo giggled in both of their faces, spraying them  with his saliva.<br>
&ldquo;Oh&hellip; oh my&hellip; isn&rsquo;t that something.&rdquo; he teared up.<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about.&rdquo; Bo was getting red.<br>
&ldquo;What kind of Hand is a scarf good for? It's&hellip; A SCARF.&rdquo; he laughed off.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what he&rsquo;s goo-&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Pass.&rdquo; Custo shoved his hand in Bo&rsquo;s face.<br>
&ldquo;Go home, little boy. You&rsquo;ve entertained me for far too long now.&rdquo; he clicked  his fancy pen, turning his back to them.<br>
&ldquo;But, but this isn't fair! This whole challenge isn&rsquo;t  fair!&rdquo; Bo stomped.<br>
&ldquo;Life isn't fair, kid.&rdquo; Custo snapped back.<br>
&ldquo;This is a judging contest. I&rsquo;m the judge. I judged you. Now ta ta.&rdquo; Custo  explained harshly as he flicked at Bo.<br>
&ldquo;He gets a pass, Custo.&rdquo; Milo wavered as he flipped a  coin to him.<br>
Custo studied the coin, shocked at the engravings.<br>
&ldquo;You and I both know this hasn&rsquo;t held any merit in a  long time, Milo.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t change history, Custo. Or shall I ask your  King what is and isn&rsquo;t worth around here?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Tsch, whatever. Group 2 and get out of my sight.&rdquo; he  snarled.<br>
&ldquo;Pleasure as always, Custo.&rdquo; Milo sarcastically bowed  and dragged Bo towards the cheering coliseum.<br>

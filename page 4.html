  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for five minutes, and I already hate  that guy.&rdquo; Bo muttered grumpily.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, me too.&rdquo; Milo smirked as he patted Bo in  reassurance.<br>
Bo and Milo, blinded by the open Colosseum, entered  through the jaws of the main gates. Met with the full power of the crowd&rsquo;s  chants and cheers in anticipation of the event.<br>
&ldquo;This is all you, bud. Good luck.&rdquo; Milo patted Bo off, walking towards the  stands.<br>
&ldquo;WAIT, is that it? No speech or advice?&rdquo; Bo stalled.<br>
&ldquo;Trust yourself. Trust each other. And you&rsquo;ll come out  on top.&rdquo; Milo spoke back, disappearing into the stands.<br>
Bo and Dio stared at each other and back at the open  arena.<br>
&ldquo;GROUP 1 AND 2, TO THE ARENA, PLEASE!&rdquo; a commanding  voice called from overhead.<br>
Bo slowly made his way to the opening, taking in the  sounds, smells, and colors. So much energy. So many shapes and tones. So  bright. He felt the butterflies again, but no fire, no blood, and no courage.<br>
&ldquo;Move, move!&rdquo; his peers shouted, shoving past him and  forming another line.<br>
Bo hustled up and fell in line. Looking frantically  for Milo. Two hundred and seventy degrees West, row one, seat one, next to the  main gate, he remembered.<br>
And there he was. Cloak dawned and hood up, consulting with another familiar  figure. A yellow and green armored man. The one he saw accompanying the boy who  skipped the line. He tried to make out what they were saying before being  interrupted.<br>
&ldquo;WELCOME ALL TO THE CONTEST OF HANDS, HOSTED BY NONE OTHER THAN YOUR ESTEEMED  HOST AND KING, CUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIST!!!!&rdquo; The announcer flared as golden  fireworks lit up the noon sky, sparking a significant shout from the green  crowd.<br>
A chubbier and greener figure, accustomed with poofier  and greenest drab than the rest, stood high among the crowd in a decked out  terrace, waving and boasting gestures for the public. Accompanied on the left  by none other than Custo and what must&rsquo;ve been the princess, wearing a small  gold crown, vibrant green and yellow accented skirt, seemingly disinterested in  the show.<br>
&ldquo;TODAY AND TODAY ONLY, THE HANDS OF MIDI, THE BEST OF  THE BEST, WILL COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD FOR A CHANCE TO ACCOMPANY THE KING AS HIS  RIGHT HAND!!!!&rdquo; the audience and Hands erupted in joy and giddy as a lid sealed  shut over the colosseum, lights flashing and panning a spotlight to the right  of the king himself.<br>
Bo watched in awe at the spectacular display before  him. Forgetting for just a moment, he was about to face his greatest challenge  yet. Which isn&rsquo;t saying much since he&rsquo;s only been awake for two days now, but  it still got to him. <br>
&ldquo;NOW FOR SOME OF TONIGHTS HIGHLIGHTED HANDS. KEEP AN  EYE ON THESE ONE FOLKS, FOR COULD IT BE THE DYNAMIC TRIO OF ROCKY, DAVID, AND  GOLIATH, FAVOR OF PETRA!!!!&rdquo; the crowd cheered away as a darker scrawny man in  nothing, but tan shorts rose, flexing enormous purple gauntlets.<br>
&ldquo;OR MAYBE LACY AND AMNIS WILL STREAM BY THE  COMPETITION, FAVOR OF LACUS!!!!&rdquo; the crowd praised and screamed as a tan  short-haired girl in a blue piece swimsuit danced elegantly with a stream of  water flowing through a whip.<br>
&ldquo;AND THE FAVORITE OF THE KINGDOM, THE GENERALS ONE AND  ONLY SON, LEO AND BOLT, FAVOR OF COELUM!!!&rdquo; the crowd erupted, loud as ever, as  the spotlight shined on a familiar golden-haired kid. Rising in his gleaming  armor, bowing for the audience, feeding their excitement.<br>
&ldquo;NOW WITH FORMALITIES CONCLUDED, LET'S GET TO THE REAL  REASON WE&rsquo;RE ALL HERE! TO SEE DISPLAYS OF AWE, CRUSHING DEFEATS, AND A  HARROWING VICTORY BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF OUR 16 CONTESTANTS WILL COME OUT ON  TOP!!!!&rdquo; the audience cheered again in eagerness.<br>
&ldquo;GROUP TWO PLEASE EXIST THE STAGING AREA AND WAIT IN  THE INNER GATE. GROUP ONE, GET READY FOR YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE, A TRADITIONAL  FAVORITE, THE CHALLENGE OF CELAS!!!&rdquo;&nbsp; the  announcer boomed as Bo, and the others of his group cleared the way.<br>
The arena fell quiet in anticipation. Sounds of  murmuring echoed throughout the dome as the first group lined up in the center  of the arena. <br>
Bo observed, leaning against the wall, for this was  all new to him in this foreign land. <br>
The lights cut off, and out of the brief darkness  shined four small metal cages in the middle of the arena. With the lights  slowly growing, the Hands circled the cage in sequence, waiting, anticipating,  silence falling upon the colosseum.<br>
Until the cages bursted open suddenly in all  directions, shooting up four small gold and green armored birds, frantically  maneuvering around the arena. The contestants exploded into a dazed frenzy.  Pillars stretching in and out of the arena blocked and gave way, pumping out of  the ground like clockwork.<br>
Bo could hardly keep his eyes on the glowing birds as  they paced spontaneously between the Hands, as they grasped at the birds and  fended each other off.<br>
Out of the madness stood out a single Hand, the golden  boy, remaining calm and collected. Waiting patiently for the right time to  strike. And just like that, like catching lightning in a bottle, he reached out  and snagged the first elusive bird. Crushing it until a bright explosion of  dust blew through the armor, forming a much larger version of itself until it  faded onto the ground, glittering.<br>
The volatile crowd erupted at the display, cheering  the name Leo as the second official challenge of group 2 went to him. Following  suit in the distraction, three more victorious contestants, though through much  more struggle.<br>
&ldquo;WOW, WHAT A DISPLAY OF PATIENCE AND GRACE FROM NONE  OTHER THAN LEO!!!! BUT LET'S BE REAL, DID ANYONE DOUBT HIM!!!! I KNOW I  DIDN&rsquo;T!!!!&rdquo; the audience agreed in infectious approval of applause and  whistling, commemorating the victors and outing the losers. <br>
&ldquo;GROUP 2 PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE STAGING AREA!!!!&rdquo; <br>
Bo took a deep breath to clear his fuzzy mind. <br>
&ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo; he exhaled.<br>
Slowly walking out with his peers, single file.  Watching the lights dim as they started circling the center of the arena, the  crowd grew quiet. Bo frantically looked for Milo, but it was too dark to see.  The pressure and sweat getting to him now.<br>
&ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo; he thought. <br>
He didn&rsquo;t think he was one of them. At least not yet.  Consumed in his thoughts, slowing his tracks.<br>
&ldquo;Hey! Pick it up!&rdquo; a voice hissed, bumping into him.<br>
&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; he apologized, picking up the pace.<br>
It felt like an eternity waiting for those cages to  drop. He didn&rsquo;t know how much longer he could stand the anticipation. <br>
Until suddenly, the gleaming white lights burst on,  releasing the armored feathered creatures from their prison.<br>
The crowd burst out with the built-up energy, cheering  and booing their Hands on.<br>
Bo got knocked to the ground, too slow for his  opponents. Picking himself up, the floor before him rose, lifting him high on a  pillar.<br>
He stood atop watching the chaos below him, Hands  fighting Hands, sporadic Knightley birds racing across the surface, ground  shifting. He took a deep breath to process it all and calm his nerves. He  exhaled and felt normal again for a moment. Whatever normal was, it was  short-lived. But it was enough to clear his head. He decided the best way to catch  a bird was through timed execution, not running around, and using brute force.  Although, it seemed to work for Rocky and his Hands as they caught one in his  giant fists, squeezing tight, releasing golden snow across the arena.<br>
Bo snapped out of it, picked his target, and studied  it. Much like how Leo seemed to pull it off. He noticed a particular bird that  made dive-bomb runs from left to right of the arena. This was his bird. <br>
He quickly located a pillar along the bird&rsquo;s pathing  and leaped over, clawing at the grips of the edge and lifting himself up and  onto the platform. He scanned the arena for his bird again as the others  started getting grabbed left and right. Lacy whipped Amnis inches in front of  his face, entangling a strafing bird to his right before his eyes. As she  winked by him, landing perfectly below, releasing the creature into a burst of  light. He panicked. Thinking his bird was taken and it was over. <br>
Until it wasn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t hear the announcer, the  pillars didn&rsquo;t rest, and neither did the remaining Hands. Bo quickly scanned  once again and found his target, coming in for another dive bomb. But the bird  had moved since he got distracted by Lacy. <br>
It was out of his reach again, diving straight at  another Hand waiting below for the opportunity. Bo didn&rsquo;t know what to do, but  he knew staying on this pillar wouldn&rsquo;t win him anything anymore. <br>
So he took a deep breath and risked it all in a leap  of faith, jumping as far and reaching out as far he could, believing in himself  to make it.<br>
The cold ground, aching bones, and empty hands filled  him with grief as he waited for another poof of gold. <br>
Except it didn&rsquo;t come. The crowd stood still, Hands  frozen in place, all eyes on him.<br>
He frowned as he didn&rsquo;t understand what just happened  or was going on. Until his face filled with gold light, gleaming from the tucks  of his scarf, Dio. <br>
He stared in disbelief as he unwrapped his new friend  and scooped up the shining bird, holding it tight in his hand. <br>
Slowly, he tightened his grip around the shell, releasing  the bird into an explosion of light before his eyes. <br>
The crowd wasn&rsquo;t sure how to react. They&rsquo;ve never seen  this Hand before, defeating their favorites. <br>
&ldquo;WHAT A TURN OF EVENTS, FOLKS! ROOKIE HAND BO AND DIO,  FAVOR OF&hellip; AM I READING THIS RIGHT?! I THINK I AM FOLKS! BO AND DIO, FAVOR OF  FATE!!!! IT&rsquo;S BEEN A MINUTE SINCE FATE&rsquo;S RETURNED TO US FOLKS, BUT WE&rsquo;LL BE  SEEING MUCH MORE THAN THAT NOW BECAUSE HE JUST GRABBED HIMSELF A TICKET TO THE  THIRD CHALLENGE!!!!&rdquo; the audience applauded loosely, whispering among each  other in such a public revelation.<br>
&ldquo;Wow, we did it.&rdquo; Bo stood still, dumbfounded by the  turn of events. <br>
&ldquo;Great job, Dio.&rdquo; he praised as he pet him.<br>
Making his way back to the inner gates, he drew the  glances of many. Some curious, some fearful, some cold. He heard the whispers,  &ldquo;Fate is back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kid is going places.&rdquo; &ldquo;He got lucky.&rdquo;<br>
All such mixed emotions. But he shook it off. He had  to. To be ready for the next challenge.<br>

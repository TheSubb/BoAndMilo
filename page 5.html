  <p>&ldquo;GROUP ONE PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE STAGING AREA  FOR THE THIRD CHALLENGE! A REAL BRUISER, THE CHALLENGE OF FORTI!!!!&rdquo; yet again,  the crowd responded with a belch of screams, applause, and chanting. <br>
The Hands split up into pairs, facing each other  meters apart.<br>
The lights dropped again momentarily until the  spotlights shined on a pair to the far right. A nimble looking man with boxers  and a girl in tattered white cloth with a black streak running across her face  wielding a shattered sword as the pieces flowed with some kind of energy,  forming the tip naturally.<br>
The colosseum came to a standstill as the two studied  each other. Until a loud buzzer rang through the dome, the Hands each struck  once ever so precisely across each other. The sword Hand fell back, recovering  posture as the nimble boxer flew across the arena into the wall, knocked out  cold.<br>
The audience cheered and applauded her before the  lights went out and shined on the next group, causing a standstill.<br>
It was between Leo and a lean hooded figure, drawing  their bow.<br>
The lights flashed off again and back on. Leo had  drawn his sword in a defensive stance as the archer readied their barrage. The  buzzer rang, and in a flash, Leo cut clean through the first arrow and  backhanded the archer with his hilt, knocking him to the ground.<br>
Again, the crowd sang for Leo, congratulating him. The lights faded, and the  swordsman and woman fell into place through the dark. The lights burned on,  showing off yet another defensive stance from Leo and an aggressive one from  the swordswoman. <br>
The crowd held its breath waiting for the buzzer. And  with the piercing signal, the swordswoman struck high. But with a simple bit of  footwork from Leo, he swept out of the way and slammed his elbow down into her  back, crippling her momentarily. But that was all that he needed as the crowd  blew a fuse over yet another victory for Leo. <br>
&ldquo;SUCH STYLE, SUCH POWER, LEO DOES IT AGAIN AND IS THE  CROWNED WINNER OF GROUP ONE. HE WILL GO ONTO THE FINALS!!!!&rdquo; Once again, the  crowd raved at the thought of Leo winning.<br>
&ldquo;GROUP 2, PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE ARENA FOR THE  THIRD CHALLENGE!!!!&rdquo;<br>
Bo was sweating bullets again. He had never fought  anything before. Or at least he could remember, besides that BoolWalker, but  that was a sneak attack. This was clearly a precision and strength challenge.  Something he wasn&rsquo;t sure he had much of.<br>
Yet, he made his way back to the arena, still  searching for Milo. But it was too dark to make out any distant face. <br>
&ldquo;I must say, I&rsquo;m quite surprised you&rsquo;ve made it his  far little Bo.&rdquo; Custo chimed in.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m full of surprises.&rdquo; He muttered back.<br>
&ldquo;Oh, I <em>know</em> now. Which is why I&rsquo;m taking no chances here, yes?&rdquo; Custo cheerfully gleamed  out.<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Bo scowled.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also in charge of pairing Hands for the fairest  matchups.&rdquo; he said with a wide smirk.<br>
Bo&rsquo;s eyes widened, realizing what was about to happen.<br>
&ldquo;You will be going against Rocky. Good luck now!&rdquo;  Custo winked as he clicked his fancy pen in his face once more and disappeared  into the darkness.<br>
Bo froze up to the sudden news. <br>
Rocky was the guy with two giant gauntlets for fists.  How was he going to beat him in a contest of precision and might? <br>
Panic set in again. He felt so alone out here on the  stage. Until a silky touch swept across his face, and Dio stared on at him, or  at least he thought he was staring at him. <br>
Dio started to glow, trying to help Bo understand that  they&rsquo;re more than just a lost boy and a scarf. He began to understand. If  there&rsquo;s one thing he understood, it was how to feel. And he felt Dio on this  one. He felt whole.<br>
Rocky appeared from the shadows before him, gauntlets  bulging.<br>
&ldquo;Hi! My name is Rocky, and this is David and Goliath!&rdquo;  he greeted, raising and waving each gauntlet.<br>
&ldquo;Oh, um, hi. My name is Bo, and this is Dio.&rdquo; Dio  gestured out, shaking Goliath and then David.<br>
&ldquo;Those gauntlets are, um, cool. I like the eye  design?&rdquo; Bo complemented awkwardly.<br>
&ldquo;Really?! That&rsquo;s so nice of you! Look, you even got  Goliath to blush.&rdquo; Rocky pointed out to a literal blushing gauntlet.<br>
&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re ALIVE?!&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Of course they are! All hands are sentient, don&rsquo;t you  know that?&rdquo; Rocky asked, puzzled in the thinker pose.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorta new at this.&rdquo; Bo admitted.<br>
The lights began to flicker out, silencing the crowd,  preparing the other pair.<br>
After a moment, the lights flickered back on to reveal  Lacy in a neutral stance standing off with a man half shrouded in armor and  half bare wielding a scythe with a red tip, eager to strike.<br>
The two stood off, awaiting the alarming noise. Until  boom, before the alarm could finish, Lacy entangled the scythe, yanking down in  one swift elegant motion. Sinking the man's own scythe into his shoulder and  holding him down into the ground.<br>
The crowd went wild, showing who the clear favorite  was in that standoff.<br>
&ldquo;Oh man, she&rsquo;s great, isn&rsquo;t she great?&rdquo; Rocky looked  in admiration at the work done.<br>
&ldquo;Uh yeah, pretty great. For her, I guess.&rdquo; Bo gulped  at the sight of what just happened. <br>
If he somehow beat Rocky, he&rsquo;d have to get past that  too. The lights lowered again, as did the noise until silence and darkness  consumed the arena.<br>
&ldquo;Psst, Bo, good luck, okay mate?&rdquo; Rocky offered.<br>
&ldquo;Mmmhmm.&rdquo; Bo squealed out, thinking of what he would  have to do.<br>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell, but I&rsquo;m trying to bump fist you.&rdquo;  Rocky told Bo.<br>
&ldquo;Fist bump me? Fist bump me.&rdquo; he thought to himself.<br>
He knew Rocky was strong. And seemingly precise. I  mean, how can you not be with gauntlets that huge. So his best bet was  absorbing or avoiding his blow and go for him while he recovers.<br>
But how would he avoid fists that big? Dio started to  glow through the dark, and Bo understood what Dio planned.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trusting you here, bud.&rdquo; Bo whispered with his  eyes closed, concentrating.<br>
With a flash of bright light, the buzzer rang, and the  titan fists came in as fast as the lights did.<br>
&nbsp;Bo raised his hand,  absorbing the full force of the blow with Dio, holding the fist in place. The  crowd gasped and screamed in fright at the turn of events as everyone expected  Bo to be paste by now. Even Rocky looked horrified for a moment.<br>
&ldquo;WOAH, BO, THIS IS AMAZI-&rdquo; Bo cut him off by pushing  the force absorbed by Dio back into the gauntlet, sending Rocky flying into the  side of the dome, stuck in a crater from the impact. The crowd looked on in  horror and silence.<br>
&ldquo;Oh my, I'M SO SORRY ROCKY!&rdquo; Bo yelled across the  arena.<br>
&ldquo;IM OK!&rdquo; Rocky faintly yelled back, remaining in his  crater.<br>
Bo looked around in the light to catch the gaze of  thousands of strangers. Looks of horror, disgust, awe, glee, you name it. He  looked again for Milo, but no luck. However, he did catch the king, who raised  an eyebrow at the display of events, Custo with his jaw dropped in terror, and  caught the bored princess&rsquo; attention.<br>
The lights faded again, turning pitch black as he  heard who must&rsquo;ve been Lacy step up.<br>
&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re the new hotshot, huh.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I mean, is that what people are saying?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Probably, but I called it first.&rdquo; she flirted.<br>
&ldquo;Oh, o-ok.&rdquo; he stuttered.<br>
&ldquo;Hmmm, that was quite impressive, you know.&rdquo; she kept  at him.<br>
&ldquo;Uh, thanks, you too.&rdquo; he tried keeping it short,  focusing.<br>
&ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s sweet. You really mean it?&rdquo; she asked  cutely.<br>
&ldquo;Errhmm..&rdquo; he grunted out, trying to remain focus.<br>
&nbsp;She was trying  to distract him. He took another deep breath and let his thoughts flow again  for a moment. Ignoring all outside noise. She was quick, didn&rsquo;t seem as  powerful, but more precise and swift. Best bet he had was being unpredictable.  But what could she never expect?<br>
The lights burned on once again. She waited in another neutral stance. He  readied in an aggressive position, sword drawn, tensing the muscles across his  body, ready for one swift movement. <br>
The buzzer blared, and she lashed out for his advanced  leg movement. But his legs weren&rsquo;t there. Instead of charging, Bo lept back, dodging  her grasp. He retaliated with his own as he unwinded Dio and stretched out for  her whip, grabbing it clean off her. Lunging forward for a body slam, knocking  her flat onto her back.<br>
The audience was silent again. The silence grew to a  slow clap and then some cheering and then shouts and then praise soaked Bo in  the light. He had finally won their hearts.<br>
&ldquo;WOAH FOLKS DOWN GOES LACY! WE GOT A HOTSHOT IN THE  MAKING! BO TAKES THE THIRD CHALLENGE AND MOVES ONTO THE FINALS!!!!&rdquo;<br>
His heart raced. He wanted to scream and run around  and cry all at the same time. He&rsquo;d come so far and learned so much. The only  thing standing between him and his destiny now was Leo.<br>
&ldquo;BO, PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE MAIN GATE, LEO PLEASE  MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE OUTER GATE!&rdquo; the announcer boomed through the stadium.<br>
Bo strutted, high and mighty, feeling the adrenaline  pumping through his veins as he was praised and cheered on. <br>
&ldquo;Pssst, Bo.&rdquo; Milo rang.<br>
&ldquo;MILO?! I was looking EVERYWHERE for you!&rdquo; Bo let out  in relief as he tiptoed up the wall to talk to him.<br>
&ldquo;I told you, two hundred and seventy degrees West, row  one, seat one, right next to the main gate.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, it was dark, and I also don't know how to  tell directions.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh. Well, whatever, look, this is the last challenge.  You win this, and you&rsquo;re the kingdom's Hand.&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Trust me, I know.&rdquo; Bo acknowledged with the pressure  creeping in again.<br>
&ldquo;BO AND LEO. PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE CENTER OF THE  ARENA!!!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Got any more of those tips or speeches before I go  out there?&rdquo; Bo asked over the sound of the crowd.<br>
&ldquo;Be yourself out there. Nobody fights like you do.&rdquo;  Milo reassured him.<br>
Bo nodded and stepped away from the stands, locking  eyes with Leo, who waited patiently at the center of the arena.<br>

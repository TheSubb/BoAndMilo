	  <p><span style="">“This one? Are you sure?”<br>
		  “Yes, <em>I’m sure</em>.”<br>
		  Two voices faintly converse in the blinding light around him.<br>
		  “Fine. But you <em>owe </em>me for this one.”<br>
		  “Yes, of course.”<br>
		  He can listen but not understand as the darkness claws towards him once again.<br>
		  “And I mean it, Fate. This isn’t a light favor. My rep is at stake here, too,  you know.”<br>
		  “I know, Death. And I appreciate your sacrifice. It’ll  pay off. <em>Trust me</em>.” She assured him.<br>
		  The voices start fading, but he wants to listen more. He wants to understand.  He wants to, before he’s taken again.<br>
		  “Yeah, yeah, I get it. But this is your last one,  alright. Takes more out of me than you know.” Death complained.<br>
		  “I’ve pulled many strings for this one. He can do it.” Fate said, fixated on a  small bright orb.<br>
		  The light is gone; the darkness grows to a  suffocation. It’s over.<br>
		  “If you say so.” Death agreed.</span>
		  <span style="">“GAAAAASSP!”  the boy coughed out. Spewing </span>water over the sand. <br>
		  “<em>What is going on</em>?” he thought to  himself, as a million other questions poured into him.<br>
		  “Where am I? Who were they? <em>Who am I</em>?”  he asks himself as panic starts to ensue. <br>
		  Hurling and coughing the rest of the water and sand out of him, he takes a deep  breath.<br>
		  “Ok, we’re ok. Let’s start with <em>where</em> are we.” he took a long look around, cupping his hand over his head to block  the harsh light.<br>
		  He appeared to be washed up on a white sandy beach. In  front and to the left of him stretched white sand, a cliffside, and vibrant  green forests for miles. To the right, green plains leading to an unfriendly  looking red canyon. Behind him, crystal blue water with a mysterious gold fog  in the far distance.<br>
		  “I’ll take my chances with the forest.” he settled on,  rising out of the sand, hopelessly brushing the specks off his bare chest and  tattered pants.<br>
		  Marching through the ominous green forest, listening  to unfamiliar sounds, sweeping the bushes aside, hopelessly looking for a  friendly soul to set him straight.<br>
		  As he stumbled through the subtle forest, colors of teal and blue crept. Trees  grew longer, bushes became bubblier, creatures stranger, and the grass softer. <br>
		  “Skitz, no. A Huggle? Meh. Oh, a Toogit…” A deep voice debated in the distance.<br>
		  “Oh, uh, HEY! HEL-” he shouted out as his excitement got the best of him,  tripping on a tangled glowing root in the ground. <br>
		  “-loooo…” he squeaked out, face planted into the clay  dirt.<br>
		  Poking at his entangled foot, he looked up to find a mysterious, tall  blue-robed dinosaur-like creature with round features looking down upon him  with annoyance. <br>
		  “Keep it down, will you, before you disturb something that’s gonna tear both  our limbs off.” the blue stranger scowled as he stepped over him, book and  orange berry in hand. <br>
		  “Agh, he-hey!” shaking the root off and freeing himself from the cursed vine.<br>
		  “Wait up for me!”<br>
		  Yet the blue fellow kept on, too busy with his reading and berry. <br>
		  “And why should I do that?” he sighed.<br>
		  “Because I need your help?” <br>
		  “You and everybody else on this continent, kid.” he  munched on his berry, face buried deep in text.<br>
		  “Please, I-I guess I’m new around here.” he shrugged,  looking up at the blue trees. Wondering.<br>
		  “The thing is, I don’t kno-”<br>
		  “On your right.” the blue fellow cut him off.<br>
		  “Wha-” he gasped out as yet another blue shining root took a liking to his  ankle, bringing him to his knees.<br>
		  “Look.” the blue stranger paused, shutting his book  and finishing his berry.<br>
		  “I’m a busy guy. Nearest village is North-East,  that-a-way.” he pointed. <br>
		  “Its name is Teal. Someone can help you there with  whatever problem you have. Now please, leave me alone.” he asked, continuing  down the path.<br>
		  Brushing off his scraped knees, he watched the mystery  figure go on about his day as if it was any other. <br>
		  “Well, thanks for that much at least.” the boy muttered as he set out for the  village. <br>
		  Lost in thought about the recent events, a terrifying scream brought him back  to reality. Frozen in place at the sound, his mind raced.<br>
  &nbsp;“What was that?  Should he run? What if someone needs help? What if the blue stanger is in  danger?” all these questions tormented him. <br>
		  He didn’t know who he was, where he came from, even  where he was...<br>
		  He did now one thing, how he felt. And right now, he  felt the fire; he felt the butterflies; he felt the blood; he felt the courage. <br>
		  Before he knew it, he was sprinting towards the unknown scream, through the  mysterious forest, ripping through the obsessed roots, catching his falls,  until he arrived at an open blue hill. <br>
		  “What th- get outta here, kid!” the familiar blue creature warned. <br>
		  “I-I heard the scream, s-so I came as fast, as fast as I could.” he panted,  resting his body over the side of a nearby stump.<br>
		  “Hey, get away from that, it-” <br>
		  Suddenly, a giant of a monstrosity leaped between  them. A three-horned hunched orange animal, twice the size of either of them,  charged the resting boy. <br>
		  He closed his eyes and braced. Waiting for the end.<br>
		  He waited, but it didn't come.<br>
		  “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” the blue creature yelled.<br>
		  Slowly opening his eyes, he saw the familiar blue fellow rather than his quick  and brutal death approaching him.<br>
		  “U-uhh” he stammered out.<br>
		  “GET OFF OF THAT!” he screamed at him, as the blue  stranger brushed him aside, inspecting the stump.<br>
		  “What’s your problem?” the boy thought he’d be happy to see him come help. Yet  his rude response left him astonished.<br>
		  “My problem is YOU.” he glared coldly over.<br>
		  “Me?! I came back to save YOU.” he screamed back.<br>
		  “Oh yeah, it looked like I was the one needing saving!” the blue creature  scoffed.<br>
		  “Well, I, ugh.” <br>
		  Cutting him off as the monster rained down on them  again.<br>
		  “MOVE!” the blue fellow commanded as he shoved him aside.<br>
		  With a moment of silence, a void of swirling blue and  black appeared out of thin air above them, consuming the aerial beast and  disappearing just as quickly as it appeared. <br>
		  “Woah.” the boy let out in amazement as the mysterious blue fellow turned back  to him.<br>
		  “It’s time for you to leave. Now.” he commanded,  shoving the boy away from the stump.<br>
		  “B-but I have so many questions!” he protested, putting on the brakes with his  heels.<br>
		  “Ugh, you really are new around here.” he panted,  shoving him away.<br>
		  Suddenly, the blue fellow was tackled from the side by an orange blur, knocking  them in opposite directions.<br>
		  Rising from his knees, the boy realized it was yet  again the orange beast as he watched it tower over the fallen blue fellow. The  fire, butterflies, and blood all rushed him at once again.<br>
		  Searching frantically for a way to save his new  friend, his eyes met a green, gleaming, overgrown sword stuck in the stump of  the tree he rested aside. He quickly sprinted to the stump, catching the handle  and yanking it from its roots with one swift pull. <br>
		  Wasting no time, he sprinted behind the beast and  jumped on it’s back, sinking the edge into the monster's back. The orange  creature let out another terrible scream, thrashing around and knocking out the  cool trees. But he did not falter as he scaled the beast’s back, grasping its  horns and slicing the front off clean before finally being flung off. <br>
		  With its injuries known, the beast retreated into the  forest in a fit of rage.<br>
		  “Ughhhhhh.” the boy let out a long groan.<br>
		  Split between relief and pain as his eyes flickered  and ears rang. <br>
		  A familiar shape came before him, hand out.<br>
		  “My name’s Milo.”<br>

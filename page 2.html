  <!-- The author information is contained here -->
  <p>His mind swirled with dark and blue, images he can&rsquo;t make sense of appearing  and disappearing before him. People he didn't know. Sights he never saw. Sounds  he never heard. Feelings he never felt. It was all too hazy. All these  pictures. Flying by him. He wanted to stay again. Find those voices. Though the  darkness was creeping in again. Devouring the images, deafening the voices,  clouding his feelings. Until there was only black, a voice spoke out.<br>
  &ldquo;Bo.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
  &ldquo;MILO!&rdquo; he snapped up in an instant of cold sweat. <br>
  &ldquo;Woah, take it easy there, bud.&rdquo; Milo said, calming  him down.<br>
  &ldquo;It was bright! But then it was dark. The images and  the feelings and the voices and-and&hellip; what happened?&rdquo; he screeched.<br>
  &ldquo;You hit your head. Got knocked out real quick. So I  took you back to my place.&rdquo; He gestured. <br>
    It was a vertical heavy house, with many small rooms  stretching up. The boy looked out the window and saw the familiar blue sea and  gold fog. It must&rsquo;ve been cliffside, only way to explain the layout of this  place.<br>
  &ldquo;After saving me from the Boolwalker, of course. Quite  impressive for being human.&rdquo; Milo winked at him.<br>
  &ldquo;No, not that. I don&rsquo;t know where I am or who I am. I  don&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo; the boy slumped down in his rather comfy chair, looking  down at his hands.<br>
  &ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m guessing this is the problem you tried to  tell me.&rdquo; Milo said, tapping his fingers together nervously.<br>
  &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well, lucky for you, I know where to find some  answers.&rdquo; Milo sat up.<br>
  &ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; the boy gasped.<br>
  &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo; Milo pondered hesitantly.<br>
  &ldquo;It could take a while, though. So we&rsquo;ll figure  something out eventually.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;We?&rdquo; the boy asked, eyebrows raised.<br>
  &ldquo;Yeah, you saved my life. Least I could do is help you  get back on your feet.&rdquo; Milo shrugged.<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo; he shouted, standing up from his  covers and hugging Milo.<br>
  &ldquo;Uh, y-yeah. You&rsquo;re welcome, kid.&rdquo; Milo piped out  uncomfortably.<br>
  &ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; he said into Milo through a tight  gripped hug.<br>
  &ldquo;How about we get some clothes other than boxers on  you first.&rdquo; he suggested.<br>
  &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; the boy realized.<br>
  &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; he blushed.<br>
    Milo threw piles and piles of garb and accessories  he&rsquo;s gathered over his time around here together for him.<br>
  &ldquo;Have at it.&rdquo; Milo said lazily as he flopped in a  nearby comfy blue chair.<br>
    Bo disappeared into the pile, only to emerge with a  vibrant shirt, studded coat, and styled tight pants.<br>
  &ldquo;Too&hellip; flashy.&rdquo; Milo wavered.<br>
    He thrashed around some more, emerging with a plain  red shirt, shorts, bag, and helmet.<br>
  &ldquo;Too&hellip; eh.. Plain.&rdquo; Milo judged.<br>
    After further digging, Bo pulled out a light blue  plush in the shape of a long dinosaur with a cup attached to it.<br>
  &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Milo said softly.<br>
  &ldquo;Mr. Cups?&rdquo; he read the tag, puzzled.<br>
  &ldquo;Hey! Leave Mr. Cu- uh, leave that alone. I have everything the way I want it!&rdquo;  he demanded as he snagged Mr. Cups back and stashed him behind the chair for  later.<br>
    The boy shrugged it off and kept digging for a while,  losing the interest of a napping Milo.<br>
    He couldn&rsquo;t find anything. Nothing stood out. Nothing  spoke to him. Nothing in the pile, at least. Out of the corner of his eye, he  could see a far bigger wardrobe across the room, slightly opened. <br>
    He checked on the knocked out Milo and slinked around  the floor to the wardrobe, creaking it open to an assortment of what could only  be explained as fashion sense. All freshly ironed. <br>
    Out of the bunch, the orange stood out to him, so he  started with that. He grabbed a plain orange shirt, some grey shorts, and brown  strapped boots. He felt almost at home, but there was one more missing piece.  So, he kept digging until he came across a familiar-looking hat. An orange  fitted hat, resembling the three points of the BoolWalker he and Milo fought.  Curious, he tried it on.<br>
  &ldquo;Hmmphf&hellip;&rdquo; Milo drooled, eyes blurry and crusty.<br>
  &ldquo;Wait no, those are speci-&ldquo; He cut himself off as his  vision came into focus, and saw Bo in the full outfit. Reminding him of simpler  times.<br>
  &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; The boy showed off.<br>
  &ldquo;Spectacular. Orange is definitely your color.&rdquo; He  concluded.<br>
  &ldquo;You think so? It just sorta, spoke to me, ya know?&rdquo;  As he fiddled with the hat.<br>
  &ldquo;Yeah, I think I do.&rdquo; Milo remanence in nostalgia.<br>
  &ldquo;Anyway, we better get a move on. Here, you&rsquo;ll be  needing this.&rdquo; Milo offered him the sword he pulled from the stump in the  woods. It was wrapped in a blue pack.<br>
  &ldquo;You kept it?&rdquo; he stared in awe at the beauty.<br>
  &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; it suits you.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
  &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal?&rdquo; the boy asked, studying his  colorful surroundings and magical life.<br>
  &ldquo;Deal with what?&rdquo; Milo raised an eyebrow.<br>
  &ldquo;The deal with this place. I mean, I may not remember  much about anything, but I still got my feels. And this place feels&hellip;  different.&rdquo; reaching his finger out to a nearby glowing particle flowing in the  wind.<br>
  &ldquo;Aha, well, uhh..You see&hellip;&rdquo; Milo squirmed nervously.<br>
  &ldquo;All you need to know right now is that this isn&rsquo;t exactly a safe place.  There&rsquo;s a lot of mysterious stuff. But we just live with it. Literally.&rdquo; he  recovered.<br>
  &ldquo;I noticed.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;That and the place we&rsquo;re going to is one of the only  places you can trust, ok?&rdquo; Milo said seriously.<br>
  &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;Because the people there are like you and me. They&rsquo;re  heroes.&rdquo; Milo kept track on the path, clearing a fallen log by warping it a few  feet out of the way.<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero?&rdquo; he said, admittedly surprised  considering how they met.<br>
  &ldquo;A long time ago. I&rsquo;m retired now, though. Have been for a while.&rdquo; Milo  shrugged off.<br>
  &ldquo;Woah, you gotta tell me about that sometime.&rdquo; he  loved stories.<br>
  &ldquo;Maybe one day, but for now, let&rsquo;s get you ready.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;To be a hero.&rdquo; Milo claimed as they exited the forest.<br>
  &ldquo;Welcome to the House of Fortos, where heroes are made  and sold.&rdquo; Showing off the old three-story, red and white bricked structure,  resting in an open field across intertwining rivers.<br>
  &ldquo;Sold?&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;Yeah, like odd jobs for the kingdoms.&rdquo; Milo tried to  explain.<br>
  &ldquo;Kingdoms?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Uh, yeah. We&rsquo;ll get to that later. First, I&rsquo;m going to need you to sit out  here for a minute while I talk to Kly.&rdquo; Milo put his hand on his shoulder,  looking him in the eye.<br>
  &ldquo;Kly?&rdquo; The boy asked again, trying to pester Milo.<br>
  &ldquo;Just. stay put.&rdquo; Milo stared blankly before walking  inside.<br>
    Upon entering the building, it&rsquo;s seen better days. The  ground level, the pub, was still rather dusty and old but built as tough as  nails. <br>
    Milo scanned the room and found a single man having a  drink at the bar. He was a rather tall, intimidating, darker, and grizzled man.  He dressed in brown and black with a dark brown jacket, a cowboy hat, a  prosthetic hand, and a single black eyepatch on his left eye.<br>
  &ldquo;Kly.&rdquo; Milo called bluntly.<br>
  &ldquo;Milo.&rdquo; a strong voice replied.<br>
  &ldquo;Here for another round, eh?&rdquo; gesturing a drink.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on business, Kly.&rdquo; approaching him.<br>
  &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the King of Viridian.&rdquo; Kly joked, knee-slapping.<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He realized, halting the hardy laugh.<br>
  &ldquo;How could I not be.&rdquo; Milo was not in the mood for  Kly&rsquo;s games.<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, you never know. You&rsquo;re a bit superstitious,  Milo.&rdquo; Kly called out, downing the rest of his drink.<br>
  &ldquo;Only a bit, though.&rdquo; he followed, slamming the empty  glass onto the bar.<br>
  &ldquo;Can you blame me?&rdquo; Milo gestured to his attire.<br>
  &ldquo;Heh, I suppose not.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well, listen. He has Alnum.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Does he know?&rdquo; Kly looked Milo in the eyes.<br>
  &ldquo;No, and I want to keep it that way. I have to be careful with this one. I  don&rsquo;t think we can afford another mistake.&rdquo; Milo looked away.<br>
  &ldquo;What about the others?&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all too young to remember. Should be fine.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; Kly turned his back again, filling his cup and downing another drink.<br>
  &ldquo;Well, we both got our jobs to do then.&rdquo; he slammed his last glass down.<br>
  &ldquo;I hope <em>everyone</em> makes the right decisions this time around.&rdquo; Kly gestured coldly to Milo&rsquo;s blue  crystal necklace.<br>
  &ldquo;Bring him in.&rdquo; finally granting permission.<br>
    Milo nodded and walked out of the pub.<br>
  &ldquo;Alright, you&rsquo;re in.&rdquo; He told the boy as he approached  him.<br>
  &ldquo;IN IN?!&rdquo; he shouted, excitedly.<br>
  &ldquo;Uh-ha, <em>of  course you&rsquo;re in. I told you I&rsquo;d get you in</em>.&rdquo; Milo whispered to him,  annoyed and looking around for others.<br>
  &ldquo;Now a quick rundown before we enter the House.&rdquo; Milo  cleared his throat.<br>
  &ldquo;No running, no yelling, no hooky, no magic, no naps, no drinking, no animals,  no&hellip;<br>
    He drifted in and out. Flashes of light and darkness  as blue orbs floated around him.<br>
  &ldquo;Bo&hellip;&rdquo; a voice reached out. <br>
  &ldquo;Huh&hellip;&rdquo; he dazed in and out.<br>
  &ldquo;&hellip; hands are never to be raised, you cannot invite others in yourself, and what  happens outside those doors stays outside those doors. Got it?&rdquo; Milo snapped.<br>
  &ldquo;Uh yeah, no naps, got it.&rdquo; he rubbed the back of his  neck.<br>
  &ldquo;This is serious. First impressions matter around here  and even more out there.&rdquo; Milo explained, resting his hand on his shoulder.<br>
  &ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s all just a bit much, but I got it.&rdquo; the boy confessed.<br>
    Milo studied him again and nodded, gesturing towards  the doorway.<br>
    Upon entering, a single darker figure greeted him.<br>
  &ldquo;You must be Milo&rsquo;s new apprentice.&rdquo; he assumed.<br>
  &ldquo;<em>Apprentice</em>?!&rdquo; he thought, eyes wide,  giddy with thought.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kly, the Keeper of the House, and you are?&rdquo; he gestured kindly out.<br>
  &ldquo;Ughhhhh.&rdquo; Milo panicked. He never even asked for the  kid&rsquo;s name. Let alone if he remembered to have one.<br>
    The boy stood there a moment, thinking. He didn't know  what his name was or should be. He dug around, deeper and deeper, and it came  to him. Whatever felt right.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bo. Bo, the&hellip; human?&rdquo; Bo slid awkwardly out.<br>
  &ldquo;A human, huh? Been a while since we had one of those.&rdquo; Kly scratched as he  thought of the last humans he met.<br>
  &ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re not human?&rdquo; Bo asked.<br>
  &ldquo;Aha, uh no, <em>Bo</em>. Kly is Idian.&rdquo; Milo  said behind a false grin and teeth.<br>
  &ldquo;Ex Idian.&rdquo; Kly starred coldly off at Milo, correcting him.<br>
  &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Milo sighed.<br>
  &ldquo;This way, young Bo.&rdquo; Kly put his arm around the kid, directing him up the  flight of stairs.<br>
  &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m so sorry</em>.&rdquo; Milo whispered to  Kly, who just rolled his eyes at him.<br>
    Upon passing the sleeping quarters of the second  floor, they pressed onto the third floor.<br>
  &ldquo;This is the Hall of Hands. Where every hero is born  and raised for their favor.&rdquo; Kly gestured in grand, showing off millennials  worth of history and power.<br>
  &ldquo;Woooaaah&hellip; what&rsquo;s a hand?&rdquo; Bo innocently asked.<br>
  &ldquo;Did you even talk to this kid?&rdquo; Kly snapped at Milo,  who tugged at the neck of their robe, sweating and shrugging.<br>
  &ldquo;A hand is the instrument of the chosen hero. Each  favor has a hand specific to their powers. Some lay here dormant for years.  Others are used and move on from hero to hero.&rdquo; he explained to Bo while  pointing him to the various displays of objects.<br>
  &ldquo;A hand is an extension of yourself, like your sword,  but spiritually as well. You are whole with each other, and without, you&rsquo;re  shattered.&rdquo; he spoke dramatically, crunching a coin with his metal hand.<br>
  &ldquo;How do I know which one will make me whole.&ldquo; Bo  asked.<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel it.&rdquo; Kly crouched down to Bo.<br>
    Bo nodded, seeming to understand that at least. He  then walked around the hall, admiring the beautiful displays of power. A single  arrow, with a purple fire engraved onto it, a reflecting sphere, changing  shapes periodically, and an empty display.<br>
  &ldquo;Hey, why&rsquo;s this one empty?&rdquo; Bo questioned.<br>
    Kly&rsquo;s eyes widened, and ran over to the empty display.<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, I get it. It&rsquo;s invisible! Wow. I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo; Bo  confessed.<br>
    Before Kly could blow his top and somehow blame Milo,  a swift figure danced across the hall, entangling around Bo&rsquo;s neck.<br>
  &ldquo;Ha, this guy seems to like me.&rdquo; poking at his new  yellow friend.<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Praisidio. The hand of Fate.&rdquo; Kly let out a  sigh of relief, solving the mystery.<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna call you Dio. Sup Dio.&rdquo; he high fived the scarf.<br>
  &ldquo;Uh, yes. It seems that, <em>ahem</em>, <em>Dio</em>, has spoken then.&rdquo; Milo smugged with  himself.<br>
  &ldquo;So now what.&rdquo; Bo asked, tucking Dio around his neck.<br>
  &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s enough for one day, and I&rsquo;m sure you, Dio, and Milo have <em>a lot</em> to catch up on.&rdquo; Kly grinned,  patting Milo a bit too hard on the back.<br>
  &ldquo;Uh, yes, of course.&rdquo; Milo said nervously, rubbing his back. <br>
  &ldquo;Oh, ok. It was nice to meet you, Kly.&rdquo; Bo and Dio  waved bye to Kly.<br>
  &ldquo;Likewise, and remember Bo, stay whole.&rdquo; He waved back.<br>
  &ldquo;Stay whole, huh.&rdquo; Bo thought, eyeing his new friend.<br>
